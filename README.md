# portfolio_app (Made using Flutter)

This app was built to play around with a few Flutter functionalities. The main functionalities are s follows.

# Home Screen
On the home screen, the user is greeted with some animated text and parallax animations. The user can then navigate to other pages via the navigation drawer.

# Photographs Screen
The main screen consists of a feed-like structure built using a GridView. The files are pulled asyncronously from Firebase Storage. On clicking on the FAB, the user is taken to a new page where he can add images from the gallery and then upload all images to Firebase. Upon hitting Upload, the screen is popped, the images are uploaded and the changes are made in the GridView immediately.

# Illustrations Screen
Same functionality as Photographs Screen but with digital artwork. :P

# Blogs, About Me, Contact Me, Login Screens
In development.



All the assets uploaded to the app are original creations of the author.
